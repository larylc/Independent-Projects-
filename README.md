Following the link above will lead you to my project website. There, I will be posting both major and minor projects. The major projects so far are in R. But I plan to be positing some of my Python projects as soon as they are completed.

## Major Projects

### Project 1: Summer Research 2018
**Summary**: To determine which individual properties, predict an individual's social network position, I analyzed the bracket to bracket movements of Forked Fungus Beetles within populations during the Summer of 2016.

<summary>Visualization Tasks and Questions</summary>
 
* Visualize the number of Pokemon per type.
* Are there more dual-types than mono-types?
* Are Pokemon with dual-types on average stronger than mono-type Pokemon?
* On average, what is the strongest and weakest type?
* Which types have the most of each stat?
* Are some generations on average stronger than others?
* Do newer generations have more variation in their stats?
* Which stats have the most and least variation?

</details>

<details>
<summary>Correlational Tasks</summary>
 
* What stats are correlated with each other?
* What stats are correlated with individual types?
* Is typing significantly correlated with stat total? Does typing predict overall stats?
* Is dual typing significantly correlated with stat total?
* Is typing correlated with sub-legendary /mystical/ legendary status?
* Which stat(s) are most useful for predicting legendary/ sub legendary/ mythical status?
* Do pokemon with better designs have higher stats?

<summary>Multivariate Studies</summary>
 
* What would a PCA cluster of Pokemon look like based on their stats?
