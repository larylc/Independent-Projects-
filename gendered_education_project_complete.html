<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-many-universities-are-in-the-us-and-why-that-number-is-changing">US News</a> reports that the United States has nearly 4000 degree-granting institutions as of 2020. In addition to degree-granting colleges and universities, there are hundreds of other post-secondary schools that provide students with certifications and professional licenses. With such a wide variety of post-secondary options, students have to pay close attention to the various distinctions that make these schools unique. Although the <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/">US Department of Education</a> collects data on hundreds of institutional attributes, students only really consider a few of these variables. Some of the common considerations are ranking, size, diversity, student life, and program success.</p>
<p>One variable that stands out is whether or not a school is a single-sex institution. Given the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-sex_education">history of mixed-sex education</a> and the progression of women’s rights in the United States, single-sex education might seem like a relic of the past, but there are still a few dozen institutions that are committed to keeping genders separate.</p>
<p>With this in mind, this project will try to examine some of the key differences between co-ed and single-sex colleges. We will be using the US Department of Education’s <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/">college-scorecard data set</a>, which contains all of the possible institution-level data one could ask for.</p>
<p>This is a very long analysis, so for a summary of all the findings, skip to the conclusion.</p>

<p>Clearly, 90 variables is a lot to consider. But as we move through this analysis, some of the variables will be eliminated or fused with other variables. For now, our concern is improving the data type of these attributes. For whatever reason, the <code>fread function</code> unpacked many of the numeric variables in the data set as character variables. So our first step will be to change the attributes to their appropriate types.</p>

<p>Our current data set has two columns that tell us the sex-specific status of our institutions (“MENONLY” and "WOMENONLY). Let’s take a look at what values these variables contain:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">table</span>(college_scorecard_clean<span class="sc">$</span>MENONLY)</span></code></pre></div>

<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">table</span>(college_scorecard_clean<span class="sc">$</span>WOMENONLY)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Although this is great information and we can see which colleges are male-only and female-only, there are a few problems. First, there are null values that are not beneficial to us. The second problem is the fact that we don’t need the variables to be separate from each other. That separation is going to make creating graphs later slightly more challenging. Lastly, there is no easy way to view co-ed colleges, as both columns only tell us whether a college is for a specific sex or not. This means there isn’t a clear way to quickly distinguish co-ed colleges from the other sex-specific colleges when using one of the columns.</p>
<p>Thus, our next block will eliminate the null values, fuse the MENONLY and WOMENONLY columns, and create a new category called “CO-ED.” We will also make sure the colleges are operational.</p>

<p>This interactive map displays quite a bit of information. First, we can see the difference in the number of colleges there are in each of the categories by changing the <strong>layers in the top right corner</strong>. Additionally, we can see that most of the colleges that are sex-specific are concentrated along the eastern side of the United States. Moreover, as you hover over the male-only colleges you can see that many of them are religiously affiliated.</p>
</div>
<div id="key-variables" class="section level2">
<h2>Key Variables</h2>
<p>Now, we can begin to analyze some of the variables that might distinguish the sex-specific categories.</p>
<p>The variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demographics (Categorically and Numerically)</li>
<li>Admission Statistics</li>
<li>Percentage of Degrees Awarded in Academic Divisions</li>
<li>Completion Rates by Ethnicities</li>
<li>Retention Rates</li>
<li>Faculty Employment Information</li>
<li>Household Income</li>
</ul>
<div id="demographics" class="section level3">
<h3>Demographics</h3>
<p>Starting with one of the categorical demographic variables, there are 8 columns of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>HBCU (Flag for Historically Black College or University)</li>
<li>PBI (Flag for predominantly black institution)</li>
<li>ANNHI (Flag for Alaska Native Hawaiian serving institution)</li>
<li>TRIBAL (Flag for tribal college and university)</li>
<li>AANAPII (Flag for Asian American, Native American, and Pacific Islander-serving institution)</li>
<li>HSI (Flag for Hispanic-serving institution)</li>
<li>NANTI (Flag for Native American non-tribal institution)</li>
<li>RELAFFIL (Religious affiliation of the institution)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look it look at what values one of these columns has.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">table</span>(college_scorecard_completely_prepped<span class="sc">$</span>PBI)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## 
##    0    1 NULL 
## 5949   94    3</code></pre>
<p>Like the sex-specific variables above, we have null values which don’t give us useful information. Moreover, because there are so many categories, we don’t want to create a chart for each one. Instead, we will be fusing the first 7 variables that are flagged for particular ethnicities, just like we did for the sex-specific categories.</p>
<p>Additionally, because the religious column has dozens of categories, creating a chart for all of them does not make sense. Instead, we are going to collapse all of the categories into religious and non-religious.</p>

<p>The 18 categories have been reduced to 10. We can now proceed to the next phase, which is to produce a plot that will test if there is a relationship between sex-specificity and demographics. One of the options we can use to plot a categorical variable against another categorical variable is a mosaic plot.</p>

<p><img src="gendered_education_project_complete_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> In this plot, each rectangle represents the intersection of 1 category from one variable and another category from another variable. For example, the largest rectangle represents the number of colleges that are both co-ed and have no ethnic flag. The larger the area of the rectangle, the more observations are in it. If there is no intersection between the variable categories, a circle with a line is used.</p>
<p>The Pearson residual colors, essentially, tell us whether we have more or fewer colleges than expected if we were to assume that demographics and sex-specificity are independent (as in there is no relationship). The presence of blue and red tells us that the variables are not independent meaning they have some kind of relationship. As we can clearly see in the plot, all of the rectangles are grey, which indicates that the two variables are independent.</p>
<p>Now, if we take a look at religious affiliation and plot it against sex-specificity, we might get something different.</p>

<p>From this chart, we can clearly see that around half of both men-only and women-only colleges are religious wheres 14% percent of coed colleges are religious.</p>
<p>To continue our examination of the relationship between sex-specificity and demographics, we will be using a logistic regression framework. Specifically, we want to answer the question “does the proportion of ethnic groups help predict sex-specificity?”</p>
<p>From our data set there are a number of numeric demographic variables to examine:</p>
<ul>
<li>UGDS_WHITE (proportion of students that are white)</li>
<li>UGDS_BLACK (proportion of students that are black)</li>
<li>UGDS_HISP (proportion of students that are Hispanic )</li>
<li>UGDS_ASIAN (proportion of students that are Asian )</li>
<li>UGDS_AIAN (proportion of students that are American Indian/ Alaskan natives)</li>
<li>UGDS_NHPI (proportion of students that Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander)</li>
<li>UGDS_2MOR (proportion of students that are 2 or more ethnicities)</li>
<li>UGDS_NRA (proportion of students that are non-resident aliens [ I may refer to them as international])</li>
<li>UGDS_UNKN (proportion of students with unknown race)</li>
</ul>
<p>With so many variables to consider, the easiest way to investigate their relationship with sex-specificity is to create a logistic regression summary table and see which variables have the most significant relationships. Because we need the variables to be binary, we will be using one of the data sets from earlier on in our project. There are a few clean-up steps like making sure the MENONLY and WOMENONLY columns are numeric and have no null values.</p>

<p>One important thing to address is the amount of colleges that were removed because of these clean up steps. We went from <strong>6806</strong> colleges to <strong>5751</strong>. Because the missing values were consistent throughout these numeric demographics, the most likely reason they were left blank was because the researchers did not have access to the information.</p>
<p>First, we will create a table that shows the relationship between each explanatory numeric demographic variable and the MENONLY response variable.</p>

<p>Because we cannot visualize a logistic regression that is more than 4 dimensions (3 explanatory variables and 1 response variable), we need to select the explanatory variables that are the most significant for our final model. There is also an extra incentive to get rid of some of these demographic variables because they are closely related and could create numerical instability. From this table, we can see that most of the explanatory variables independently have significant relationships with the MENONLY variable. The NRA variable and NHPI variables seem to have the least significant relationships with the MENONLY variable.</p>
<p>Now we will create a multivariate logistic model that takes into account all of the remaining variables to see if we can eliminate more explanatory variables.</p>

<p>Here, some of these variables seem to have very large standard errors. The larger the standard error, the less precise the statistic, meaning the samples may not closely represent the population. A large standard error could be caused by having a small sample size, a large standard deviation, or a combination of both. To keep things simple, we will be removing the AIAN, 2MOR, and UNKN variables too because of their very large standard errors.</p>

<p>Now, our table shows UGDS_ASIAN is not only statistically insignificant but also has a large standard error compared to the other three variables. Additionally, UGDS_HISP also appears to be statistically insignificant. With this in mind, our final model will only incorporate two variables (UGDS_WHITE and UGDS_BLACK).</p>
<p>But before we do the finalizing, we should perform a couple of steps. First, we should check if there is collinearity between our two variables so that it does not create instability in our model.</p>

<p>So it looks like the variables are very correlated but not so much that they create instability.</p>
<p>Second, we should compare our model (with proportion of black and white students) to a model without black students so that we can see if the standard errors drastically change.</p>
<p>We are just going to rename the UGDS_BLACK variables so that our final plot is easier to to read.</p>

<p>The standard errors between models don’t differ much, so we are free to use our first one (with both black and white students).</p>
<p>Our final model shows that there is a significant relationship between being a men-only institution and particular proportions of certain ethnicities. Specifically, we can see that there is a positive relationship between men-only institutions and white students as well as a negative relationship between men-only institutions and black students. This finding does not seem too surprising because our map above showed that many of these institutions were seminary schools, which one can safely assume are mostly white men. But for the sake of transparency let’s take a quick look at a table of these institutions:</p>

<p><img src="gendered_education_project_complete_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-2.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> As we can see from the graphs, the relationships between these demographic variables and sex-specificity are still fairly small despite the statistical significance of the models. Testing the accuracy or recall of the models does not seem appropriate given how weak the relationships are.</p>
</div>
<div id="admission-statistics" class="section level3">
<h3>Admission Statistics</h3>
<p>During the previous section, we had the numeric variable be the explanatory variable and the sex-specificity (a categorical variable) be the response variable. In this section and for the rest of the sections, sex-specificity is going to become the response variable. This transition was made, firstly, because creating logistic regression models for each one of these questions is going to be too much of a pain. Secondly, because these variables under investigation seem to have, for the most part, small relationships with gender, I feel the best thing would be to use a logistic regression framework using only the most significant variables. What would probably work best for an exploratory analysis like this one would be an anova framework that allows us to get a quick glance at the data using bar charts.</p>
<p>Our next step is to answer, “how do admission standards differ across the sex-specific colleges?”</p>
<p>Here are our explanatory variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>ADM_RATE (Admission Rate)</li>
<li>SATVRMID (SAT Verbal Median)</li>
<li>SATMTMID (SAT Math Median)</li>
<li>SATWRMID (SAT Writing Median)</li>
<li>SAT_AVG (SAT Overall Average)</li>
<li>ACTCMMID (ACT Cumulative Median)</li>
<li>ACTENMID (ACT English Median)</li>
<li>ACTMTMID (ACT Math Median)</li>
<li>ACTWRMID (ACT Writing Median)</li>
</ul>
<p>Because there is a strong possibility that these variables will be collinear, it would be a good idea to take a look at what the overall averages are for each sex:</p>

<p>Women-only colleges being on average more selective is not surprising. With only 35 of them and there being very well known selective institutions like Scripps College and Barnard College, these findings were more or less expected. However, what came as a bit of a surprise was the selectivity of men-only colleges. Normally, as admission rates go down scores go up. Notice that the admission rates for men-only colleges is much higher than co-ed and women-only colleges. If men-only colleges are more selective, then we should see an admission rate under 60 percent. Additionally, since none of the men-only colleges are as selective as the most selective women-only colleges, what is driving these averages up so high?</p>
<p>Let’s take a look:</p>

<p>I knew it! Something was indeed going on here! Because most of the male colleges have NA’s, for their admission test statistics, only 5/61 contributed their numbers to those averages. This means that while most of the women-only college standards were averaged, only the more selective men-only college averages were used. This also makes sense because if most of your colleges are seminary schools, how could your average be so high?</p>
<p>This finding actually makes our job easier because the only valid variable to use is admission rate given the scarcity of data for the admission tests.</p>

<p>Here, we can clearly see that there is a significant positive relationship between admission rates and men-only institutions. Although women colleges did not cross the significance threshold, you can clearly see that there is a negative relationship between admission rate and women-only colleges.</p>

<h3>Majors</h3>
<p>For this section, I had two interesting questions:</p>
<p>Does attending a sex-specific school affect degree outcomes? Does going to a women-only college affect STEM degree outcomes?</p>
<p>Because the US Department of Education collects data on the percentage of students that graduate with particular majors, there are a lot of variables to work with!</p>
<p>However, since we are only interested in major academic divisions, we should be able to fuse most of these percentages and compare them that way. I decided to group them by three major divisions: Liberal Arts, STEM, and Professional/Vocational/Other.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Many of these majors could have fit into a couple of groups, but in the interest of keeping things simple, I based my decisions mostly on this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_fields#Professions_and_applied_sciences">wikipedia page about academics fields</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of the variables:</p>

<p>The liberal arts model shows that both men-only and women-only institutions have a positive relationship with proportion of liberal arts degrees. This makes sense because many of these institutions (especially men-only) award religious and humanities degrees. For the STEM model, both men-only and women-only colleges have a negative relationship with percentage of STEM degrees. However, only the men-only relationship with STEM degrees is significant. Lastly, both men-only and women-only institutions have significant negative relationships with the percentage of professional and vocational degrees (men-only more significant).</p>

<p>I think it is pretty safe to say that if you are attending one of these male-only colleges, you are probably going to end up with a liberal arts degree.</p>
<p>One limitation of these methods is the fact that we could not get data that showed the degrees conferred by gender for co-ed institutions. Although co-ed institutions give more STEM degrees than women-only colleges, we need to keep in mind that this is the average for both genders. Because the number of men in STEM is usually higher than women in general, we could hypothesize that the average proportion of degrees conferred to women in co-ed colleges is lower than what is seen above.</p>

<p>From this table, it looks like both mean and median earning outcomes are positively associated with women-only colleges, albeit slightly. Both measurements are negatively associated with men-only colleges, but they are insignificant. One thing to note is that the median outcome for men-only colleges is almost significant.</p>

<p>The first summary table shows a significant negative relationship between faculty salary and being employed at a men-only institution. In contrast, there is a positive relationship (albeit slightly significant) between faculty salary and being at a women-only college. Additionally, the second table shows a very significant positive relationship between the proportion of full-time faculty and men-only institutions.</p>

<p>It looks like there is a significant positive relationship between median household income and attending a women-only college. Conversely, there is a slightly negative relationship between median household income and attending a men-only college.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, this project was an opportunity to use a variety of new tools to answer some interesting questions. I made use of spatial tools, data manipulation tools, and interactive graphical tools. Considering the extensive amount of findings in this project, I think it is safe to say that there are key features that distinguish men-only and women-only colleges. Here is a summary table of all variables that had significant relationships with the particular school types:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="49%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>MEN ONLY</strong></th>
<th><strong>WOMEN ONLY</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Religious Affiliation (positive)</td>
<td>Religious Affiliation ( positive )</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Proportion of White Students (strong positive)</td>
<td>Proportion of Nonresident Aliens (weak positive)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Proportion of Black Students (moderate negative)</td>
<td>Percentage Liberal Arts Degrees (strong positive)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Admission Rate (strong positive )</td>
<td>Percentage Professional &amp; Vocational Degrees (strong negative)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Percentage Liberal Arts (strong positive)</td>
<td>Mean &amp; Median Earning Outcomes (weak positive)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Percentage STEM Degrees (strong negative)</td>
<td>White Student Completion Rate (weak positive)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Professional &amp; Vocational Degrees (strong negative)</td>
<td>Black Student Completion Rate (moderate positive)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>White Student Completion Rate (strong negative)</td>
<td>Hispanic Student Completion Rate (moderate positive)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Nonresident Alien Completion Rate (strong negative)</td>
<td>Faculty Salary (weak positive)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Faculty Salary (strong negative )</td>
<td>Median Household Income (strong positive )</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Proportion of Full Time Faculty (strong positive)</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Median Household Income (weak negative)</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>With all of these results in mind, I think the next step would be to use some the variables in this table to create more complex multivariate logistic regression models that could predict sex-specific institutions.</p>
